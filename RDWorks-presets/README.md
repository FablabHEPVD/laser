# RDworks-presets

This is basically a backup and a development maybe platform of the RDworks cutting presets that can be loaded through the GUI. 

This is not a file a user can import... This is something that needs to be overwritten in the installation folder prior to running the application. 

The normal location is 
`C:/RDWorksV8/ Param.lib`
