# RDworks-presets

This is basically a backup and a development maybe platform of the RDworks cutting presets that can be loaded through the GUI. 

This is not a file a user can import in the software... This is something that needs to be overwritten in the installation folder. 

**However, RDWorks does NOT need to be reloaded for this to work!**

The profiles are loaded only as the user clicks on the Parameter-library button.

This means one can switch Parameter libraries on fly. Awesome üëç

The normal location is 
`C:/RDWorksV8/ Param.lib`
